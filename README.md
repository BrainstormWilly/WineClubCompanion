# Wine Club Companion #
Have you ever met a "Cruiser?" A Cruiser is someone who loves cruises. They usually go on a cruise at least twice a year. The wine industry has something similar that we'll call a "clubber." A wine clubber is someone who belongs to 2 or more wine clubs. The dilemma of a wine clubber is managing their accounts and shipments for each account. This app is designed to be a sort of "SSO" for wine clubbers to manage their credit cards, addresses, shipment times, and other account info, as well as sign up for winery events and private tastings.
